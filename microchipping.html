                <p>At Julie’s Pet Scanning and Microchipping, you will receive a professional microchipping service throughout Neath, Port Talbot, Swansea, and Aberdare. Microchipping is a crucial step in ensuring your pet's safety and compliance with UK law. It is a legal requirement for dogs to be microchipped from six weeks old by the breeder, before they leave for their new homes. I provide a convenient and stress-free service to meet this obligation. At a day and time to suit you.</p>
                <p>Our microchipping process is quick, safe, and effective. We ensure that each microchip is registered and accurately linked to your contact details. This ensures that if your pet ever goes missing, they can be quickly and easily identified and reunited with you. Our team is dedicated to providing the best care and support for your furry friends.</p>
